## Demo

![Taskgo demo](./demo/taskgo.gif)

## Features
  * Vim Style keybinds
  * Uses markdown file to store data (which is very readable)

## Install 
**Note**: Currently the only way to install taskgo is to build from source.

Make sure that you have [setup](https://golang.org/doc/install) go properly on your system and you have `$GOPATH/bin` in your `$PATH` variable (for linux/macOS) or environment variable for Windows.

```sh
$ go get -u github.com/singalhimanshu/taskgo
```

This will create a taskgo binary under `$GOPATH/bin` directory.

## Usage

Simply run `taskgo`. This will create a taskgo.md file in your current directory.

### Keybinds

You can press `?` in the application itself to see the keybinds. But for reference they are here as well -
